# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive EDA process performed using Python, focusing on understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.

## 📁 Project Structure

## 🧠 Objective

The goal of this EDA is to:
- Understand the dataset's structure
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Prepare data for further modeling or insights

---

## 📌 Key Steps in EDA

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked data dimensions and previewed the first few rows using `df.head()`

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (nulls)
- Removed duplicates (if any)
- Checked for data types and converted where necessary

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
- Used `df.describe()` to get summary statistics
- Analyzed the **mean** of numerical columns to understand central tendencies

### 4. Mean Analysis
- Calculated the mean for all numeric features:
  
```python
df.mean(numeric_only=True)

Why Mean Analysis?

Understand the average behavior of each feature

Spot outliers or unusual distributions

Prepare data for normalization or feature engineering

## Data Visualization
Used matplotlib and seaborn for visual representation:

Histograms for distribution

Boxplots for outlier detection

Correlation heatmaps

Pairplots to examine feature relationships

6. Correlation Analysis
Analyzed correlation between features using .corr()

Visualized relationships with a heatmap

📈 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

💡 Insights
Mean values revealed skewed distributions in certain features

Visuals helped in understanding patterns and detecting anomalies

Data is now better understood and ready for next steps like feature engineering or model training
