# ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 

Welcome to my Exploratory Data Analysis project! This repository contains a comprehensive EDA process performed using Python, focusing on understanding the structure, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.



## ðŸ§  Objective

The goal of this EDA is to:
- Understand the dataset's structure
- Identify trends, patterns, and anomalies
- Prepare data for further modeling or insights

---

## ðŸ“Œ Key Steps in EDA

### 1. Data Loading
- Imported the dataset using `pandas`
- Checked data dimensions and previewed the first few rows using `df.head()`

### 2. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values (nulls)
- Removed duplicates (if any)
- Checked for data types and converted where necessary

### 3. Descriptive Statistics
- Used `df.describe()` to get summary statistics
- Analyzed the **mean** of numerical columns to understand central tendencies

### 4. Mean Analysis
- Calculated the mean for all numeric features

### 5. Data Visualization
- Used matplotlib and seaborn for visual representation:

- Histograms for distribution
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Correlation heatmaps
- Pairplots to examine feature relationships

### 6. Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
